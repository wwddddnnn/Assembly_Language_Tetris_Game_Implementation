## This is a Teris game inmplemented in assembly language using MIPS Simulators. ##
- The game is like the traditional Tetris, where the player can control (move left- press A, right- press D, down- press S, rotate- press W) each tetromino. When tetromino drops to the bottom, a new tetromino will be generated from the top.
- The game has the full set tetrominoes, where all 7 shapes are implemented.
- The player could be able to view the next tetromino on the right side of the game display.
- The game can be quit anytime by pressing key Q
- When the game fails(when tetromino has touched the top border), a game over will be displayed and the player can restart the game by pressing R.
- When one row is full, the row will disappear with animation.
- When no action is taken (no key is pressed), the tetromino will drop on pixel every 1 second.
